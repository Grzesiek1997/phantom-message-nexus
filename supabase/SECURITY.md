# Database Security Improvements

This document outlines the security improvements made to the Supabase database configuration to address issues identified by the Supabase Database Linter.

## Security Issues Fixed

### ERROR Level Issues

1. **Security Definer View**
   - Issue: The view `public.v_blocked_summary` was defined with SECURITY DEFINER, which enforces Postgres permissions of the view creator rather than the querying user.
   - Fix: Changed the view to use SECURITY INVOKER instead.

2. **RLS Disabled in Public Tables**
   - Issue: Multiple tables in the public schema didn't have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled.
   - Fix: Enabled RLS on all public tables and created appropriate RLS policies for each table.
   - Tables fixed:
     - `public.blocked_users`
     - `public.participant_settings`
     - `public.messages`
     - `public.message_reactions`
     - `public.bots`
     - `public.bot_interactions`
     - `public.attachments`
     - `public.biometric_data`
     - `public.users`
     - `public.friends`
     - `public.conversations`
     - `public.conversation_participants`
     - `public.biometric_settings`
     - `public.biometric_auth_attempts`
     - `public.user_devices`
     - `public.checkout_sessions`
     - `public.feedback`

### WARNING Level Issues

1. **Function Search Path Mutable**
   - Issue: The function `public.register_user` had a mutable search_path.
   - Fix: Set a fixed search_path in the function definition.

2. **Auth Leaked Password Protection**
   - Issue: Leaked password protection was disabled.
   - Note: This setting needs to be enabled in the Supabase dashboard under Auth > Configuration > Security.

### INFO Level Issues

1. **RLS Enabled No Policy**
   - Issue: Some tables had RLS enabled but no policies defined.
   - Fix: Created appropriate RLS policies for these tables:
     - `public.calls`
     - `public.message_attachments`
     - `public.message_edit_history`

## RLS Policy Design Principles

The RLS policies were designed with the following principles:

1. **Least Privilege**: Users can only access data they own or have explicit permission to access.
2. **Data Isolation**: Users cannot access other users' data unless explicitly allowed.
3. **Contextual Access**: Access to related data (like messages in a conversation) is determined by the user's relationship to the parent entity.

## Manual Steps Required

1. **Enable Leaked Password Protection**:
   - Log in to the Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to Auth > Configuration > Security
   - Enable "Leaked password protection"

## Testing

After applying these changes, it's recommended to:

1. Run the Supabase Database Linter again to verify all issues are resolved.
2. Test the application to ensure all functionality still works as expected.
3. Verify that users cannot access data they shouldn't have access to.
